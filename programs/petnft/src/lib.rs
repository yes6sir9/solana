//! PetNFT on-chain pet registry.
//!
//! IMPORTANT — MVP SCOPE (see repo README "MVP / mock" section):
//! This program has been written but NOT compiled, deployed, or tested —
//! the development container used to build the rest of this repo has no
//! Rust/Solana/Anchor toolchain installed. Treat this file as a solid
//! starting point, not a verified build. See README for the exact steps
//! to install the toolchain, run `anchor build`, fix any compile errors
//! that surface, and deploy to devnet.
//!
//! What this program does: the actual NFT (mint account, SPL Token
//! account, Metaplex Token Metadata account) is created by the frontend
//! directly via the Metaplex umi SDK, signed by the player's Phantom
//! wallet (see frontend/src/services/nft.ts) — that is the standard,
//! battle-tested way to mint a Solana NFT and doesn't require a custom
//! program. This program adds one thing on top: a small PDA account,
//! one per mint, that records the pet's identity data on-chain in a
//! form a smart contract (or another program) could verify directly,
//! instead of trusting PetNFT's backend database. Mutable gameplay state
//! (current stats, XP, hunger, etc.) intentionally stays off-chain in
//! the backend DB in this MVP — see README for the tradeoffs.
//!
//! Mint-payment / treasury / dynamic pricing (brief section 30) currently
//! live entirely off-chain: the backend verifies a plain SystemProgram
//! transfer to a treasury *address* directly against devnet RPC before
//! creating a pet (see backend/src/services/solanaVerifyService.ts) —
//! there is no on-chain program enforcing the price or holding funds in a
//! PDA-owned vault yet. Moving that verification into this program (a
//! `mint_pet` instruction that atomically checks payment, mints, and
//! writes the PetRecord PDA in one transaction) is the natural next
//! hardening step — not yet implemented here.
